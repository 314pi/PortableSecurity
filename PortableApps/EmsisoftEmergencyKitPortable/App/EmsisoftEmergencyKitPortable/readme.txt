#####################################################################



                     --- How it works: ---


The Emsisoft Emergency Kit contains a collection of programs that 
can be used without software installation to scan for malware and clean 
infected computers. 


Emsisoft Emergency Kit Scanner:

  The Emsisoft Emergency Kit Scanner includes the powerful Emsisoft 
  Scanner complete with graphical user interface. Scan the infected 
  PC for Viruses, Trojans, Spyware, Adware, Worms, Bots, Keyloggers, 
  Ransomware and other malicious programs.  

  Run the Emsisoft Emergency Kit Scanner with a double click on:
  Start Emergency Kit Scanner.exe
  
  Detected Malware can be moved to quarantine or later deleted. 


Emsisoft Commandline Scanner:

  This scanner contains the same functionality as the Emergency Kit 
  Scanner but without a graphical user interface. The command line 
  tool is made for advanced users and is perfect for batch jobs.

  To run the Emsisoft Commandline Scanner, perform the following 
  actions:

  - Double click the file "Start Commandline Scanner.exe" to open a 
    new command window and display the available scan parameters.

  or

  - Open a command prompt window (Run: cmd.exe) with Administrator rights.
  - Switch to the Emsisoft Emergency Kit folder (e.g.: cd c:\eek\bin64\)
  - Run the scanner by typing: a2cmd.exe

  Next you will see a help page describing all available parameters. 

  The following parameter is an example of scanning drive c:\ with 
  Memory and Traces (Registry) scan enabled, and archive support active. 
  Detected Malware is moved to the default quarantine folder.

  a2cmd.exe /f="c:\" /m /t /a /q="c:\eek\quarantine\"

  

                     --- 32 and 64 bit notes ---

Emsisoft Emergency Kit contains two folders: bin32 and bin64.

You may either directly navigate to the right folder and start the edition 
that matches your operating system or simply use the starter applications 
in the package root folder.
  
If you run either of the editions to perform an online update, the other 
edition will always be updated too.
  
The 32 bit edition can not be started on 64 bit Windows and vice versa.
